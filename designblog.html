      <strong>what I did:</strong> <br /><br />
      Looks like SSL cert is active! <em>nice.</em> Added rule to force port 80
      traffic to https. For about two minutes, all port 80 traffic with the
      destination myfriendspets.com was redirected to https://www.example.com.
      So, you know -- <em>that</em> happened. Discovered that apparently with my
      provider's implementation of cpanel, Options -Indexes can be added to
      htaccess files -- which is really neat, but would have been nice to learn
      last night instead of thinking this could only be done in an httpd file
      and, thus, configuring it via provider's gui instead. Actually: just
      discovered that apparently putting this command in htaccess requires a
      certain allowoverride options configuration somewhere else, so in all
      likelihood, the way I did it yesterday is mandatory for my provider. Ah
      well -- I know how to do it three different ways now. <br /><br />
      exif is the bane of my existence. just trying to figure out how to deal
      with this rotation problem. downloaded one app that seemed to be doing
      something, but not following my expectations. Started looking into another
      app and wondered whether I can just let my code deal with exif instead of
      all this nonsense. turns out I can! found a cool piece of CSS in MDN web
      docs: image-orientation: from-image. and, sure enough, this works!...in
      firefox. tested in chrome, does nothing. so, back to square one. started
      thinking about the app I started with and realized it was working, I was
      simply misunderstanding the behavior: when I stripped the exif rotation,
      the image still looked wrong but it had <em>already been wrong</em> and
      now Windows was just presenting it without the exif. rotate, boom fixed.
      resolving this took longer than I'd hoped for but ultimately I'm left with
      a quick and straightforward solution for stripping exif rotation, so I'm
      not complaining. <br /><br />
      with the rotation issue sorted, I was free to move onto stripping the rest
      of the metadata, which can be done easily in Windows. beginning to develop
      a workflow: save received images in "raw" folder, make a copy, move to
      "stripped of metadata" folder, rename. soon, will add "resize for
      thumbnail" step to this process. Probably want to add "confirm no exif
      rotation" at the start of the workflow too. would love to one day automate
      as much of this as possible; probably going to kick that particular can
      down the road from here to california. replaced previously-hosted images
      with scrubbed images. re-enabled gallery page.
      <br /><br />
      one friend/user pointed out that having a click-to-enter-the-site index
      page is hilariously 2005, so as much as I love that specific picture, the
      index has got to go. thinking this through: don't really want to rename
      gallery to index: what if folks try to navigate to gallery.html and get a
      404? did some research on this; turns out you can change the landing page
      of the domain using the DirectoryAccess command in the htaccess file.
      COOL!
      <br /><br />
      was going to call it a night here, but really wanted to go ahead and get
      the resizing done so that page load times aren't oppressive before I start
      soliciting more pictures. goofed around with image resizer powertoy; works
      like a dream for batch-resizing down to a given max width. picking 600 and
      making my peace with the fact that the site is not going to look good at
      resolutions above 2400 by X. oh well.
      <!--¯\_(ツ)_/¯-->
      tricky thing is that, ideally, I'd like to rename the files slightly
      rather than try and keep track of identical image names in a "gallery
      size" folder. took a little poking around but looks like the powerrename
      powertoy can support appending via use of regex, so that's pretty cool.
      very lightweight but very powerful tool. uploaded renamed and resized
      images. fun fact: the biggest delta in image size was one that was reduced
      to 1/40th of the full file size. cool right? changed &lt;img&gt; pulls to
      grab the gallery-size images. removed disclaimer about image size. added
      href mailto link. moved some text on this page to header tags for
      readability. <br /><br />
      probably not going to do a ton of work on the site over the weekend; I
      have to finish FFVII Remake and, obviously, that's pretty important.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>features I'd like to add:</strong>
      <br /><br />
      eventually this page should have some kind of a future work / future
      features checklist so that that data isn't spread across the various days'
      posts. need a favicon. thinking about commissioning a nice one. like,
      pixel art of a cat or something.
    </p>

    <h3>4/16:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>what I did:</strong> <br /><br />
      changed gallery to two-column temporarily to avoid the impression that the
      duplicated images are a glitch. started getting organized with onedrive
      for easy shared cloud access of pictures between devices.
      downloaded/uploaded new submissions. wrote blog entry for yesterday's
      work. created some barebones style for this page so looking at it doesn't
      burn my eyes. checking gallery I created last year to see how I handled
      resizing images. apparently I was super lazy and let the pictures load in
      the gallery at the same size I provided on clickthrough. I should be
      jailed for that. thinking about how to best handle resizing
      systematically: perhaps resize to certain pixel value in width dimension?
      tried three columns to see how it looks compared to four -- pleased with
      the result. turned out to be a problem for relatively low-res photos
      though. really torn between switching back to four columns or just dealing
      with the low res picture. ultimately four columns is PROBABLY the better
      option; will make the page load faster. switched back to four columns.
      added today's new pictures. created test page so I'm not hacking together
      changes on a page someone might actually be browsing at that time (after
      today >_>). one of these pictures is rotated 90 degrees left but ONLY on
      the gallery page. WHAT. WHY. click through and it's fine. thought this
      might be an exif data issue. hadn't really thought about metadata
      security. checked and found a photo with gps information. crap. don't have
      time to fix this right now so I'm going to take the page down for a day
      and upload clean images tomorrow. learned how to disable indexing for some
      increased security.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>things I need to fix:</strong>
      <br /><br />
      test page is security by obscurity right now; need to investigate how to
      set 403 on certain pages/paths. need to strip all exif data from pictures
      submitted so far and reupload. need to implement some kind of version
      control.
    </p>

    <h3>4/15:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>what I did:</strong> <br /><br />
      received some pictures. devised initial file naming nomenclature (will
      probably need to revise this later). hosted photos. shopped around for
      some gallery designs. picked a very basic responsive flexbox design to
      start with just to get a gallery published as quickly as possible. had an
      issue with columns not presenting properly; only had three columns taking
      up 75% of the page. realized this was because I'd neglected to set
      box-sizing: border-box in CSS. (what is this, amateur hour?) played around
      a little bit to make sure images of various size were going to fit
      properly. didn't have enough photos yet (7) to get the visual language of
      the gallery working properly so duplicated images as a placeholder.
      created this page. set gallery images as links to full-size photos. made
      index page image link to gallery but this is sort of broken right now by
      responsive code.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>things I need to fix:</strong>
      <br /><br />
      CSS is a mess; I threw a bunch of style into HTML just to publish as fast
      as possible. need to organize all CSS. &lt;head&gt; tags are a nightmare,
      need to fix this too and add doctype/meta/title tags. need to create some
      rudimentary visual style for both pages. need to develop index page and
      fix the weird ahref behavior. need to resize gallery images ASAP. make
      gallery page into index page for "gallery" path? SSL cert is STILL
      pending; looks like it's not broken at least. need to force https once
      that goes through.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>features I'd like to add:</strong>
      <br /><br />
      add pet info (names, maybe more?). hover effects on photos. random "pet of
      the day" pic? some sort of randomization of gallery (per load? per week?
      HTML? js?). gallery per pet? photo captions? add page-per-pic with more
      info, maybe "previous/random/next" links? maybe with that implementation
      can do "show me more of this pet" (random)? is gallery infinite scroll or
      does it have pages?
    </p>

    <h3>4/14:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>what I did:</strong> <br /><br />
      bought the domain. organized hosting. configured tons of dns records for
      this and another domain. configured distribution list for incoming mail to
      organize submissions properly in mailbox. tried to get ssl certificate to
      go through. cried when it didn't. created basic index page. did some
      research on basic responsive design. successfully implemented basic RWD on
      index page.
